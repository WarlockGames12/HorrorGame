# Read Me About my game: Ride Back Home.

### Game is made by: Warlock Games Studios (Dirk ten Have)
##### This game is my 3rd attempt to make a horror game and I am right now hoping of succeeding this project. Maybe I consider putting this on steam for free, just to put my name out there. In this game story, I used some elements from other stories, like: one of the SCP's from the SCP foundation. I always wanted to make a small series of particular events happen inside of a small area of towns and cities that are close to each other and tell small stories about the made up urban legends they have there in that made up area.
